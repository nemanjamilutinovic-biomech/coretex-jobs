id: image-augmentation
name: Image Augmentation
description: Task template for performing image augmentation on image datasets.
  Input to the task is an image dataset, while the output is an image dataset
  with augmented images generated from the input dataset.
  Each of the images in the input dataset get passed through an image augmenter
  pipeline which transforms the image in various ways based on the parameters
  of this task.
